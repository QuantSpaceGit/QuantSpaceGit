## Purpose

QuantSpace builds tools for quants who care about correctness, speed, and clarity.  
Our work spans data engineering, simulation frameworks, and research workflows that scale cleanly.

We focus on:
- High-integrity market data pipelines  
- Event-driven and vectorized research engines  
- Corporate-actions–aware pricing and adjustments  
- EDGAR/XBRL ingestion  
- Fast, testable factor research environments  
- Cloud-native delivery patterns

Everything is built with a minimal surface area and a long-term engineering mindset.

## Projects

- **QTrader**  
  Event-driven research and execution engine.

- **Adjusted Data Pipeline**  
  Corporate actions, split/merge handling, and time-series normalization.

- **EDGAR Parser**  
  Structured extraction of 10-K, 10-Q, and exhibits.

- **Qlib Workflows**  
  Factor research templates and experimentation flows.

More repositories coming as we consolidate the internal architecture.

## Philosophy

Quant research deserves the same engineering discipline as distributed systems:  
clean interfaces, observable behavior, and predictable performance.

Our goal is to give researchers leverage — without unnecessary complexity.
